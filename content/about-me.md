I grew up in Switzerland. Studied there, worked there. Never moved more than 20km. In 2011, my wife's Company decided that I had to quit Switzerland and go live in Singapore.

So in September 2011, I left job, family, friends, flat, car and more than 30 years of well known surroundings to cross near half the planet and start a new life.

After more than a year, I decided to start a blog to share some of the good things, some of the bad things and some of the odd things.
