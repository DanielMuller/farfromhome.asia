In 2011, the only International train in Singapore was dismantled. The line leading from Tanjong-Pagar to Johor Barhu was stopped and the track removed to give way to magnificient hiking path from Tanjong Pagar to Bukit Timah, Woodlands and Johor.<!--more-->

But there is a more unknown line, still lying on and under the ground, long forgotten from most peoples, called the Jurong railway system, linking Jurong industrial estate with the Tanjong Pagar-Bukit Timah line.
